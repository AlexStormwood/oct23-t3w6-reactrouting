# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Goals 

Goals:
	- ReactJS with Vite! 
	- "Single page application" concept 
	- React Router package 
		- Component-based routing (traditional) vs Object-based routing (new)  
		- Nested routes
			- component-based absolute
			- component-based relative 
			- object-based absolute 
		- The "Outlet" component 
		- Links
		- NavLinks
		- Redirection 
			- Navigate (component)
			- useNavigate (sneak-peek at React hooks!) 
		- Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe route params 
			- this would be a lot easier with more React hooks knowledge!
